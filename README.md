Summary:

This is a unique battlepass script for your players with many features and optimizations.

Features:

- Battlepass Leveling System works with playtime which is also configurable if you want to increase level requirement after every level (All levels are having 300 minutes as playtime as default).

- Supports Multicharacters.

- Level rewards, such as items, weapons, money, black_money, bank.

- Custom reward packages (Optionable). That means, if you want to give multiple items, money or anything at the same time in a level reward, you can create a pack in Config.levelRewardPacks called for example “clips” and add this pack as a reward type in order to give multiple items (in this pack i would give all magazine types).

- Some basic images are included (Suggested images size is: 128 x 91 | 128 x 128), otherwise displaying images will not be correct.

Commands:

- /battlepass - Allows you to open battlepass.

- /setbattlepassexp - Sets battlepass current level exp progress on the selected player id.

Make sure before starting the script to change the items in the config
